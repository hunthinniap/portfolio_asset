从睡梦中惊醒

窗户外的点点星星

墙上映着我的背影

闪烁的手机屏

房间里是冷冷清清

没有一条通知提醒

空荡的房间

模糊的视线

窗外的灯光显得如此遥远

窗边烛光摇曳

点起一根烟

望着飞机渐渐 消失在地平线

It is 10pm, it is not early but the night is still young.

Welcome to the pre-midnight emo chanel 

It is not the time for toss and turn

And not the time for calling somebody either

So just wrap up your dinner and do the dish

There is couple of hours of free time before sleep

Maybe you can go to the gym but it is hard to  

Nothing to do, just stare in the static screen

While switching between different apps

Hoping time just passes

我只是你渴望蓝天时 无尽的黑夜
