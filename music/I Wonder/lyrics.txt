The first draft was made two years ago before last relationship

And I recorded a full song last birthday which is in between

now it is the final version after another relationship

It is said that if you keep thinking about something

You can write it down and then it won’t trouble you

So this is the real emotion, no more making up words for rhyme

so here we go


開頭有多少愛，結束就有多少恨

Year ago I wrote this line，沒想到一語成讖

在最開始的開 始 是否就想著如何脫身

結果假戲成真，昨日的夢，醒來仍 滿身傷痕


二十出頭的年紀，有人走向婚姻

有人在拼湊破碎的心，有人只想要性

有人今朝有酒今朝盡興，心事無人傾聽，

只要你吸他陰莖，讓他射精，要他怎麼都行


我聽過很多謊言 也聽過真心話

只要被夾住雞巴 就不會計較真假

只有在夜深人靜 時候 內心在掙扎

付出會有變化嗎 還是只要有得插


我不想對別人有惡意的揣測 雖然也會下意識的配合

有時候也會在夜裡痛徹 心扉 有時候也會陷入自責

I don't know whether i deserve to be loved

世界上孤獨的人太多也不差我一個 不如及時行樂 


I wonder why do people fall in love

Even they are destined, all the pains and regrets

Do time really changes, how people see their life

I wonder I wonder I wonder 

Does true love even exist 


我從小就乞教着 人着學了變較堅強

社會攏是比誰較雄，比誰較勇

只好共 情緒隱藏，有時陣 姑不而將

愈來愈 無法面對我真實的 面容


我毋知影安怎理解别人的想法

想慾講出自己心裡抑感覺 夠吃力

講話彎彎斡斡，誰聽了會捌

一日閣 一日過了無通瞭解的生活


我經常感覺被利用 被傷害

奸恁老母肏膣屄，真正當恁爸毋知

我只是毋愿共人想甲遐尼歹

Ok fine，好膽你著試看覓 


有時季你感覺我是 鐵齒甲慾死

其實私下底 我已經有幾百擺放棄

欲望對我說 好像是一項罪惡的代志

說袂出喙的話變成傷口面頂拔袂捒的刺


I wonder, why others seems so strong

They don’t hide their weakness and show their preferences

Maybe I am just too shy or maybe I am afraid

I wonder I wonder I wonder

Am I scared to be alone


I am writing my personal statement it’s like a flashback to all my achievements

Tryna pick up those memory fragment, represented  my commitment and 

AND what would I do if I went back those moments


Did I usually reject some possibility

Or did I find next safe place rather randomly

How would I make decision alternatively

Would I end up in the same place ultimately


I was always taught things should be attached with meaning

It force me to make excuses for all time wasting

The thoughts of being productive is exhausting 

Why can’t I just sit back, do nothing, and be chilling?


Recently I am thinking how to fight against nihility in life

Passing everyday, nothing comes only guilty arrive

It is constantly questioning if the choice is right, if you are satisfied?

With status quo, can you have more


I wonder, is everything I deserved

All the way winding, were they really worthy

I don’t seem to know, where the path is leading me

I wonder I wonder I wonder
