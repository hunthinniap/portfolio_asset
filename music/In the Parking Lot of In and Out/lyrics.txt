Open my eye, sunlight slip to the wall

The clock is dimming, it is already 5 pm

It must be from the fucking working and drinking last night

Below the window, cars all rushing by

The fridge is so empty

 So is my body 

And i’m naked in front of it 

My mind suddenly goes blank

I’m just driving aimlessly on the highway away from the town

So many cars run against me, they are having fun, maybe another time

I'm doing fine, just a random dining place up the hill

It will be completely alright

Leaning on the bumper, feel the wind on my hair

A girl comes toward, I wave and say hi

Empty parking lot, we sit together, share a cigarette

Watching the sun goes down, merges to the sea

Just two lone souls at friday’s dusk

There's nowhere we can go

In this impatient time 

Time and time i was wondering love that comes fast don't ever last

Time and time i’m still believing that someday there will be someone 

Sitting next to me just like now even we don't know each other

It will be completely alright

The sun has rise up we been talking all night
