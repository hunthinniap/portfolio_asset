It’s pouring rain outside my window

Grab my coat, try to feel the coldness

Lit a cigarette, see the smoke faded away under the streetlamp

My heart pounds so fast, I can’t hold back


Walk on the empty street, only few cars pass by

Now I’m all alone, and have nowhere to go


Some people they just want to see the flashing lights

They live in the present, being someone who just come and go

I just want those feelings to last

Although they hurt me at night, like right now I’m outside
